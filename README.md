CS-250 Software Dev Lifecycle

#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The user needs are learned through meetings with the person. This is usually done by the Product Owner who may have focus groups or specific meetings with
stake holders that communicate exacly what they are looking for in a program. These are turned into "User Stories" which the developers can then use to figure
out the best way to make this program function in such a way that will result in what the user wants. 

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I like to figure out what I'm trying to accomplish and then move straight into creating some starter code that can do what I want. From there, I'll make some improvements
and changes to get closer to a more functional type of program. I always start with lower hanging fruit of something that is easier to create just to start the framework.I'm 
hoping to incorporate pair programming into the work I do at some point or where I work. I think pair programming would be a great way to be mentored and possibly learn
a lot in an area that I may not be as strong in but I also like to be able to educate and teach someone else how to learn as well. Being able to collaborate is always nice when
you can talk things out loud and work it out within a discussion. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Everyone can have a difference of opinion but if I had to choose three, I would say that a good team member communicates continously, is flexible yet reliable, and 
overall enjoys the work they do. Communication in any field is very important. The person needs to be able to understand when communication needs to be initiated as well 
because there is definitely such thing as too much communication. Someone who is flexibile in my mind, is less likely to get upset about changes that may arise. I know 
that changes can be difficult and annoying sometimes but people have to learn to embrace change and be flexible where they can in order to get the job done. The last one 
is probably more of a work culture ideal, but there is a huge difference between someone who enjoys the work they do vs someone they don't and a lot of the time, these people 
may not realize how much harder they can make work for others. I'm a huge advocate for following work that you enjoy doing in order to assist the business with what they are 
doing but also being happy and fulfilled on an individual level. If people are generally unhappy in their position, I think it can be a toxic relationship for both the business and the wellness of the employee so I would say it's quite important.
